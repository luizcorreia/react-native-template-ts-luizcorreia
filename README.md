## :space_invader: React Native Template TypeScript from Luiz Correia


This project aims to create a template that can be used when creating projects using React Native, since the process of installing and configuring libs at the beginning of a project can generate some complexity and often even errors that delay the process , thus hindering the development flow.

> Clean and minimalist React Native template for a quick start with TypeScript.

## :star: Features

- Elegant usage directly within the [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli)
- Consistent with the default React Native template
- Minimal additional dependencies
- Eslint and prettier pre configured

## :arrow_forward: Usage

```sh
npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-luizcorreia
```
